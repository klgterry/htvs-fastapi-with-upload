    <h1>Empowering Drug Discovery with Multiscale AI</h1>
    <p>
        AIDD combines artificial intelligence with computational science to accelerate early-stage hit discovery
        through scaffold exploration, HTVS, and de novo molecule generation ‚Äî building an integrated AI pipeline
        that connects hit-to-lead and optimization seamlessly.

    <h2>üîç About AIDD</h2>
    <p>
        Our AI Drug Discovery strategy leverages proprietary algorithms and in silico simulations to build
        integrated pipelines across discovery stages. Unlike traditional AI platforms that stop at hit generation,
        our system bridges hit-to-lead, optimization, and experimental feedback ‚Äî forming a closed-loop learning cycle.
